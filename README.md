## TicTacToeGame
### About:
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as
Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs us the game, but thankfully 
it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly.
### Description:
In this small project from JetBrains Academy I'd dealt with planning and developing a complex 
program from scratch, handling errors, and processing user input. I've used JUnit library 
for checking and controlling correct perfomance.
### Launch example:
* java -jar TicTacToeGame.jar
### Technical information:
* Java 8 (Oracle OpenJDK version 1.8.0_311)
* Library JUnit 4.13.1
